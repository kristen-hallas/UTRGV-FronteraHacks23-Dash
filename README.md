# Frontera Hacks - A Dash

Welcome! My name is Kristen - I'm a PhD student at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) and a mentor for [Frontera Hacks](https://fronterahacks.com), the inaugural hackathon hosted by [Frontera Devs](https://fronteradevs.com). This repo is designed to be a quick and easy intro to the [Plotly](https://plotly.com) dashboard. 

To get started, you will need:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.org/)
* Your favorite Python IDE ([PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is great!)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) (recommended)
* A dataset to visualize ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) is a great resource!)

Some helpful Terminal commands include: 
- Make directory = `mkdir`
- Change directory = `cd`
- Go up a directory = `cd ..`
- Run a Python app = `python3 app.py`
- Run Jupyter Notebook = `jupyter notebook`
- Quit a running Python app or Jupyter notebook = `ctrl + c`
- Install a library = `pip install dash`

Python libraries required for this code to work: 
* Numpy 
* Pandas
* Plotly
* Dash

## Navigating this repo
* `exploring-v1.ipynb` is an introductory guide to using pandas dataframes and making plotly plots
* `exploring-v2.ipynb` contains a bunch more plot examples, including examples with timeseries data 
* `/app/` folder is where the Dash app and assets can be accessed and modified as you see fit
* `Frontera Hacks.pdf` contains my workshop slides 

Thanks for reading :) feel free to download this whole repo, and have fun!
