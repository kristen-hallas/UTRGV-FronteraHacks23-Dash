# Frontera Hacks - A Dash

Welcome! My name is Kristen - I'm a PhD student at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) and a mentor for [Frontera Hacks](https://fronterahacks.com), the inaugural hackathon hosted by [Frontera Devs](https://fronteradevs.com). This repo is designed to be a quick and easy intro to the [Plotly](https://plotly.com) dashboard. 

To get started, you will need:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
* Your favorite Python IDE ([PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is great!)
* Jupyter Notebook (recommended)
